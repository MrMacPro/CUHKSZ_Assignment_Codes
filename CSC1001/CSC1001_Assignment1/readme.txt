All of the code is written in Python.
You can run these code with "python NAME.py" in the command prompt.
-e.g. "python q1.py"

MyLib.py is a header file where my function is defined.
It is imported for several times in the code.
So it should be in this directory.

q1.py is the initial deposit amount calculation.
Input the final account value in the first line.
Input the annual interest rate in the second line.
Input the number of years in the third line.
Output is the initial deposit amount.

q2.py is to output each digit of the integer.
Input is the target integer.
Output is each digit of the integer.

q3.py is to find the smallest n such that (n*n)>m.
Input is the target number m.
Output is the result n.

q4.py is table printing.
Input is the target integer.
Output is the table.

q5.py is prime finding.
Input is the target integer.
Output is the prime numbers smaller than target.

q6.py is numerical integration calculation.
Input the function in the first line.
Input the left side of the interval in the second line.
Input the right side of the interval in the third line.
Input the accuracy in the fourth line.

***Importantly, when the input doesn't meet the requirement of the code, the code will ask you to input again until the input is valid.
