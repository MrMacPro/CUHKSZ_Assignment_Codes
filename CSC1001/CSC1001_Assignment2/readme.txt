Here is a brief statement about how to run my code.

For q1, 
The solution is in file "q1.py". There is no main program in this file. There is only a function sqrt() which takes 1 number as input. The function output the approximated square root of the input number remaining 4 digits on fractional part. The error of approximation is within Â±0.0001. You can open a python shell and call the function with following commands:
	>>>from q1 import sqrt
	>>>sqrt("INPUT_NUM")

For q2,
The solution is in file "q2.py". The program takes no input and output first 100 emirps. You can run the program by using following command in the command prompt:
	\123090823>python q2.py

For q3,
The solution is in file "q3.py". The function isValid() takes 1 integer as input. The function is robust enough to handle any input. If the input is a valid card number, output True, otherwise False. You can open a python shell and call the function with following commands:
	>>>from q3 import isValid
	>>>isValid("INPUT_CARD_NUMBER")
There is also a simple demo in the program. You can also run the program itself by using following command in the command prompt:
	\123090823>python q3.py

For q4, 
The solution is in file "q4.py". There is no main program in this file. There is only a function isAnagram() which takes 2 strings as input. If 2 inputs are anagram, output True, otherwise False. You can open a python shell and call the function with following commands:
	>>>from q4 import isAnagram
	>>>isAnagram("INPUT_TEXT1","INPUT_TEXT2")

For q5,
The solution is in file "q5.py". The program takes no input and output the state(open/close) of lockers after the operation. You can run the program by using following command in the command prompt:
	\123090823>python q5.py

For q6,
The solution is in file "q6.py". The program takes no input and output a random solution of 8 queens problem. You can run the program by using following command in the command prompt:
	\123090823>python q6.py
